## INSTALLATION
Run an `npm install` to install all dependencies


## STARTING THE SERVER
This runs on port 5000

### THE DATABASE USED HERE IS MONGODB AND RUN LOCALLY, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE AN OFFLINE MONGO DATABASE INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE

### This api runs cuncurrently with my front-end `Ecommerce Front-end` found among one of my repo

Happy Coding!
