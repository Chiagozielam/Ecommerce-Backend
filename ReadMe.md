## INSTALLATION
Run an `npm install` to install all dependencies


## STARTING THE SERVER
This runs on port 5000

### THE DATABASE USED HERE IS MONGODB AND RUNS LOCALLY, SO YOU NEED TO HAVE AN OFFLINE MONGO DATABASE INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE AND STARTED

This api runs cuncurrently with my front-end `Ecommerce Front-end` found among one of my repo

Happy Coding!
